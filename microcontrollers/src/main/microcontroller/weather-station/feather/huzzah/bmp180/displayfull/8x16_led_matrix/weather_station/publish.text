  - Mount to eave 
  - enclosure for All Electronics
  - Pre enclosure overnight test run
  - E6000  for all connections
  - [x]Try to fix the Verter
    + Resolder the USB connection again, again
    + Side breakouts
        * Put header on the side breakouts that do have voltage
        * Make a power connection for the Feather Huzzah from the Verter headers
    + It seems to work, but I am not sure the Verter is actually doing anything for the whole circuit.
