As a thermal printer owner
I need to control the printer from a single board computer
so that I can send dynamic print content from a Linux environment.

Acceptance Criteria

The Adafruit example code is available on the SBC filesystem and
the SBC makes a connection with printer using Adafruit example code and 
the printer prints the example pages from Python.
