As a thermal printer owner
I need ensure the basic operations work
so that I have confidence connecting it to a single board computer.

Acceptance Criteria

The printer is connection to power and
the printer turns on with the red light lit and
the feed button actually feeds the paper and
holding the button on power prints the test page and
the test page shows the printer's baud rate and
the Adafruit Arduino sample code works with the printer.
