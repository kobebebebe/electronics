As a weather watcher,
I need a Web-enabled display,
so that I can view at a glance temperature feeds.

The display shows sensor location and sensor value and
the display has the following modes
    weather
    user text
    time
    rotate (through the other modes)
the Web application has data entry screens to maintain feeds and
the Web application has controls to set the current mode and
the Web application controls and back end APIs are secured with a password.
